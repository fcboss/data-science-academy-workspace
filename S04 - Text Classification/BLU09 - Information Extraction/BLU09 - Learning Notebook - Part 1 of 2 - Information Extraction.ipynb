    "Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. Information Extraction may be presented in three subtasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition**, retrieve entities (like persons, location, etc.) in the text. \n",
    "* **Relation Extraction**, find the relation between two entities in the text.\n",
    "* **Template Filling**, find the correct entity to fill a certain template, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this BLU we are going to learn some of the basic techniques to extract specific (pre-specified) information from textual sources. From the three specified task, we are going to **focus on the task of named-entity recognition (NER)** where our objective is to **retrieve all the mentions** of entities like persons, locations, time, among others. The other two are mentioned for the sake of completeness and you should definitely research more about them, specially if you're eager to learn more about NLP.\n",

In fact I would have expected them to be happy nobody was there. That\\'s fucking ridiculous.\\n\\nSomeone said something like that during the Sens-Rags series and I couldn\\'t stop laughing.

They canceled my policy for nonpayment a week after cashing the premium check that we sent them. \\n\\nThey keep mailing me \"past due\" bills even though I have electronic payments set up and they\\'re being paid. But, the worst is that every time I call them their customer service reps are clueless. They take days to respond to anything that can\\'t be immediately solved over the phone. Same thing if you ask for a supervisor - 24-48 hour call back. \\n\\nI\\'m ready to give up and pay for private dental.  OK. this proves it whoever did this is a moron and can\\'t read intel sites showing the real relations between these entities. Nice propaganda tho. Keep trying while going down Those are pretty good.

Mostly because of the traffic converging from both timberline and skibowl, all trying to get back to Portland. Some days can be a breeze and others horrendous but with government camp being decently close stopping for a quick bite to let some time pass is always a solid choice.

Hopefully this idea can be used at some point. one would assume they would conduct an investigation to determine if criminal activity occurred.  Were they to determine it had, a criminal case might ensue (the process would involve handing it over to the prosecutors office to make a determination).

Keeps you at a good angle to avoid most of his crap. Spectral tears so you can stay behind the rocks. Not a run winner, but for an item I laughed off at first, I\\'m finding more and more reasons to pick it up.  lets see how deep this rabbit hole goes... Of course I would, why would you think I wouldn\\'t. I wear hijab but I know the struggle. It was very difficult for me to take the step. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t that I thought hijab is oppressive and backwards. \\nIt wasn\\'t that I denied that it\\'s an obligation in Islam. \\nIt wasn\\'t that I wanted to dress in a way that would arouse men. \\nIt wasn\\'t that I didn\\'t pray and had practically no personal relationship with Allah. \\nIt wasn\\'t that I had big sins I wasn\\'t ready to let go of yet and felt it would be hypocritical to wear hijab. \\nIt wasn\\'t that I had no knowledge of Islam. \\nIt was simply that I was afraid...\\n\\nAfraid of people\\'s reactions, afraid of being treated differently (I know how they think about Islam and Muslims), afraid of having less chances etc. I *hated* myself for apparently fearing people more than Allah, but it was just extremely difficult for me. I can\\'t really explain how hard it was. It was a form of social anxiety/phobia and it took me years to finally be able to take the step. The tears I dropped in those years could probably fill a pool. The struggle was real, that\\'s all I\\'m saying. But people don\\'t see that. They just see your public sin and judge you based on that.\\n\\nThis was *my* personal struggle with hijab, but other girls can have different issues with hijab. Or they do wear hijab but have different struggles. Everybody sins, but they sin differently. I know a lot of people struggle with praying on time, porn addiction, masturbation, boyfriends/girlfriends, gambling, drinking, whatever. Some feel guilty about it and others don\\'t. The only consistent thing is that everybody has their own struggles and we don\\'t know who\\'s more beloved by Allah. I mean why is your name in the history books? Gutenberg who? The printing press guy? Nobody would give a shit nowadays if your last name was Gutenberg. It\\'s not even famous really. Isn\\'t everybody\\'s name in the history books if you look long enough? It\\'s a meaningless statement to say your name is famous without more information.\\n\\nI also highly doubt that if your family is actually famous that it doesn\\'t help you in life. \"Problem solving skills\" are improved when you waistband your dick in school so the girls can\\'t see your wee wee [deleted] https://imgur.com/a/DbbfT I would go for Sorcery because of The Ultimate Hat most of the time, it sounds really cool to be in Huge Doggo form more often, 33s downtime on Ult sounds insane.\\n\\nIf the enemy is a CC Heavy Comp I would opt for Precision, with the \\'Super Dangerous Game\\' rune and the Tenacity one, sounds good for surviving teamfights and waves of CC.

If you insert a print statement that shows low, high, and mid each time you recalculate them, I think you\\'ll see some strange values.\\n\\nConsider this code:\\n\\n            low = values[mid] + 1;\\n\\nIf low=0 and high=4 (because there are 5 items in the array), this will set low equal to 1 + whatever **value** is in the middle of the array.

You don\\'t want low=656, you want low=3.\\n\\nSee the difference?\\n\\nThat mistake is in both your recalculation of low and of high. \\n\\nAnd then: once you reset either low or high, you can recalc mid based on these new values.  mid=(low+high)/2 no matter what, right?\\n I think it\\'s been called a trace rifle.

Zendikar was about discovery, Journey was about going to the realm of the gods, and Ixalan is about exploration, so it makes sense. Hence **prediction** what is the point of this \"So it\\'s safe to assume the short timeline of events that occured in the interval before the rewind would cease to exist?\" lets see how deep this rabbit hole goes... Right now you should catch up with the 7 deadly dragons. Get Key of \"insert dragon name here\" from each dragon and finish all story quest in /battleundere. Then do the first quest from a glowing LED dragon and pick up the drop. They would later release items for those who possess the 7 keys and the quest drop. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to farm xp and gold, /battleground is the best place. \\n\\nFor weapons, get the doomblade of destruction. It\\'s worth getting it considering the dmg and xp, rep, and gold boost it gives you. Probably the only weapon in game with these boosts combined in one weapon.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t been on for 4-5 years, then I assume you missed finishing 13 lord of chaos. It\\'s an interesting storyline so I would recommend completing it.\\n\\nOther than that, aqw is packed with adventures and new items, so keep in track with the news, and patch notes.

Thing is family is extremely important to me so stuck between a rock and a hard place. K/D matters in every situation, including public events. My counter argument to that is that we\\'ve faced two really bad offenses, specifically two really bad running teams, the cardinals and the browns who are bottom 10 in rushing. Heck, even the rams are 20th in rushing yards per game. If we face a high powered offense like the patriots or falcons, we will get exposed. Big time. is that good or bad?

Since there are a lot of people talking about my window size, instead of replying individually to everyone I\\'ll just say it here - it\\'s just personal preference. I don\\'t really enjoy playing with a big screen, and I feel that I don\\'t perform as well when doing so. I kinda like being able to see my surroundings without really having to move my eyes too much (or at all), and am very used to the SQM size of this particular size. I also enjoy having a bigger chat, but that\\'s just a nice bonus, I mainly do it for the screen\\'s size. Too used to it by now, I guess! \\n\\nI apologize if it made the video uncomfortable to watch for some of you. Fullscreen should make it much better, but if you\\'re on a phone, it really would suck, so, sorry bout that! \\n\\nI usually do my videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcf5x3wpV3Q), the only reason I\\'ve been uploading my hunting videos with the entire screen is so you guys can see the Hunt Analyzer, Preys, stuff like that.

Theres only so much he can do, the rest is on the Puerto Ricans to actually rebuild themselves. Just look at all of his tweets about Puerto Rico from the past 24 hours.

I definitely wouldn\\'t say I hate him  but this makes me think of his hollywoodreporter profile. In the part where his castmates describe him, Patrick said he thought Ryan was famous because production was always talking to him more than everyone else. And he was featured prominently in a lot of the promotion for the season.\\n\\nSo I think it\\'s more of a backlash because people feel like he\\'s transparently being fed to them as the face of the season.

And if he never got injured, things could\\'ve been a lot different in the play offs. Because you don\\'t sign up for football, run in a pretty standard way by the coach? Can we summon the ghost of Patrick Swayze to hash this all out?  [deleted] Do you even know what a walled ecosystem is?\\n\\nOr are you just repeating it because you think it makes you looks smart? [deleted] I definitely see a ton of red flags. Your mom is abusive, for sure. She also sounds super unstable, and it must be exhausting having to deal with her constant up and down fluctuations.\\n\\nYour best bet is to avoid her when possible and prepare for the day when you can move out to go to college and get some distance. In the meantime, don\\'t trust her with ANYTHING. Keep your valuables locked up when possible. Don\\'t let her have access to your money.  She\\'s already threatening to take away things you own and apparently feels justified in this. Don\\'t doubt that she\\'ll make good on those threats one of these days. I agree 100%. Truth be told, I wasn\\'t a fan of Susperia (sp.). Scream is like #100 for me. Yikes I\\'d actually been working under that assumption since the first Vecna fight until this week. If you haven\\'t already, see a doctor. Obviously, your hand is critical to your occupation. It\\'s also much easier to sustain another injury when you have to compensate for an existing one. You may have a fracture. Either way, a doctor should help get you on the fastest path to recovery. He is a shitbag. I despise him worse than Don Lemon. At least Lemon is openly a hater. Cernavich is a ambulance chaser of the quick blog views.  I\\'m pretty sure there is a physical deluxe version as well.

I mean it\\'s hard to know since I don\\'t know who you are or what your preferences are, but yes if you want a serious, dedicated, anarchist communist group with intersectional politics and lots of experience in organising then sign up to their emails and see what you think from there. Also there\\'s https://www.facebook.com/WorkersSolidarityMovement if you\\'re on Facebook. And a Twitter, etc. I did fart, for the record Politics  Evolution convinced you that evolution is false? Why not just admit that you don\\'t know why evolution is false, but you just wish it were?\\n\\nThose threads also got some highlights from here. But there are still plenty of snarky comments to smarter posts on those threads, from people like stcordova. And I still see quite a few posts that aren\\'t very high, but are correct.\\n\\nIt\\'s not demonstrably false. It\\'s you selecting only favorable facts to support your case, without looking at the whole picture.\\n\\nHow many non-creationists are allowed to post to /r/creation? I rest my case. Somebody with better skills than me... Please r/reallifedoodles this. lets see how deep this rabbit hole goes... all hail gold i wouldnt go for a high pop clan, find a small clan and build it up. You will make better clanmates and you will find there are always people to do things. I was in a 55 player clan and it was dead, joined a 26 player clan and it was full of assholes that wanted to be carried through everything, joined a 5 player clan and i have been playing every night and they are always up for raids, nightfalls ect. Small clans are the way to go in my book. Sack incoming.  Bless her.... I hope she\\'s the kind of person who just never takes her laptop out in public.  That\\'s what freaked me out so much when upper management thought it would be okay to just let it die. I can imagine that if this resident was able to somehow get better and came back, she would be pretty pissed to know we allowed her pet to die.  He pop him with a 30-30???? Awesome.... I make soap and lotion and I\\'ve thought how cool it\\'d be to do sonething similar to this with lotion. Almost like a little milkshake kiosk.

It\\'s the same medication from the same vial and they were okay with the baby receiving via the less effective and, arguably, more miserable route. I still don\\'t understand their objection.  The Simpsons, just let it be over please Just looking for advice to know what to do. It was an okay episode, but the reasoning behind it was strong.  Jon knew there was no way Cersei would ever agree to any alliance unless she saw a wight for herself.  It had to be done.\\n\\nAs for the episode itself, I think it did suck due to the heavy use of \"redshirts\".  Most of the deaths were from random people that we didn\\'t even know.  They were just death fodder. I saw something about that. I think he article said Apple knows the issue and is pushing out an update. My new issue is battery life with IOS11 but thats another issue altogether.\\n We didn\\'t have a QB coach until January of this year. No, I\\'m not joking. Technically a sequel considering Star Wars took place a long time ago. Both sound great but the 92 has insane headroom. It can handle all types of extreme redlining without sounding bad.\\n\\nI think the 92 sounds better overall (I never redline anything anyway) but I might  be biased, since  I absolutely adore  everything about the 92. I would be interested to hear an official statement about if they sound identical at some low level though. Why is it bad that a tv show is make you think for a second and ask yourself a question? It\\'s not mindless tv. That means it\\'s at least somewhat decent, and better than most of the shows out there. I\\'m sick of explaining this to people. It\\'s a Duplass Brothers production.

Most CC\\'s(Community College\\'s) will have you take a placement tests and that will determine which class levels to take. In an ideal world you would have a good chunk of change saved up for life after the corps and use that to pay for CC Courses and you would crash at your parents place. Once your done with your Core Classes and begin your transfer to a University and start using your GI bill.

Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) \\n\\nOn this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn\\'t tell if it was good or bad because, well I\\'m a bigger guy and in Japan it\\'s already a big disadvantage lol \\n\\nWith the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could\\'ve been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from \\n\\nSo we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.\\n\\nNow I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.\\n\\nShe caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. \\n\\nWe sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a \"western man\" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said \"very big\" (now for record, she\\'s clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)\\n\\nShe told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. \\n\\nAfter I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth \"you must wait\" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.\\n\\nI stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.\\n\\nWe finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!\\n\\nShe sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.\\n\\nAfter willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i\\'ll never forget.\\n\\nI had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.\\n\\nAfter seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.\\n\\nSo I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. \\n\\nThere was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.\\n\\nWe lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I\\'m in Japan next we\\'ll be able to hook up again :) [+BriannaMGoux](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/737yli/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnocfl4/):\\n\\nI\\'m not sure, but I\\'m glad they\\'re trying to do it. \\n\\nFun fact: I got to feed giraffes once and I cried Wasn\\'t there a thread with the opposite happening? The poster\\'s dog kept attacking some other guy\\'s dog, and that owner kicked the attacking dog and the poster was indignant that someone would dare to try to prevent his dog from attacking another one, because it was just playing or whatnot.\\n  \\nAnyway, the reality is that while dogs are great, other owners aren\\'t. They often let bad behavior go on and sometimes even encourage it.\\n\\n  I mean it\\'s just as nice during the day as well. Mercy!!! That is an immoral act and should be censored to protect the children. At least they should have made it an option to rub two sticks together to make a fire.

And it\\'s worse when it\\'s done deliberately. It\\'s not so much the act itself but the reason behind it.

I was thinking that \\'data\\' is almost like a unit of measurement. How much data supports a proposition/theory is often a measure of its likely accuracy. So in this way I wish it were standardized so we could use data vocabulary to communicate how much confidence we have. Saying \"we have datum supporting it\" should be higher confidence than \"we have data supporting it\". But obviously context would make this apparent most of the time. Anyway, good answer.

The difference is in whoever is claiming to interpret said prophecy. If Matthew does not have any authority, then you pretty much can throw out almost of all Christianity. \\n\\nSecondly who knows maybe you could reinterpret it, but the reason they would get laughed at is because there would be reasons to go against that belief. People also did interpret Daniel, and Revelation for thinking the end times were in the 70s-80s because of the cold war. And actually that belief was a big reason the modern version of the rapture is still professed today, so they were not laughed at.\\n\\nIt\\'s very important to look at the context behind the interpretations.

It was made by PDP (Then known as Pelican) to interact with Rock Band. Every song made from Rock Band 1 through 2 plus all the DLC contains Stage Kit commands to go along with the song. Rock Band 3 actually did not support the stage kit at launch (due to it\\'s low sales), but a later patch added it back in, although I think all RB3 DLC and disc songs just had a sort of \"generic\" stage kit support based off BPM or something.\\n\\nThe reason it was 360 only is the stage kit re-uses the rumble information channel for a standard controller to send the stage kit controls for what it does. Since the PS3 did not support rumble at all at the time, it never got the stage kit. Unless your teacher said that before 1995, he was mistaken.

Here is the post for archival purposes:  \\n\\n**Author**:  _uacdeepfield_ \\n\\n **Content**:  \\n\\n &gt;Why can we see this? 2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.\\n\\n3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.\\n\\nRecently the \"new meta\" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren\\'t really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  \\n\\n4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn\\'t qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery\\'s team) since his team wasn\\'t able to qualify. i think this is a solid coin\\n I saw Wazzu go victory from the gun last night, we may need to look into that.
